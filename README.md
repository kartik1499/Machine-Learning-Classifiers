# Machine-Learning-Classifiers
Comparing performance of various classifiers in Machine learning using R language

Below is the list of the classifiers implemented:
1. Decision Tree
2. Support Vector Machines
3. Na√Øve Bayesian
4. kNN
5. Logistic Regression
6. Neural Network
7. Bagging
8. Random Forest
9. Boosting

To run the code, use following script:
RScript compareClassifier.R "(dataset-path) (header in dataset-T/F) (index of the class attribute in dataset (numeric value))"

A shell script is also included to test this code.
